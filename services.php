                    <p>While most people would say it's the garage door opener, 
                    the springs on your garage door actually do most of the heavy lifting to move your garage door. 
                    If your garage door is suddenly not raising and lowering the way it did just a few days ago, 
                    you may have a broken garage door spring. Your garage door's springs are arguably the most important and most dangerous part of your door.
                    Springs wear out and break. If your door has two springs, replace both, even if one is not broken. 
                    This will not only prevent any damage caused by the breaking of the second spring, 
                    but also keep your door working efficiently. If you have a broken garage door spring, or other issue effecting your garage door's performance,

                    <p>Garage door cables play a very important role in how your garage door operates. When a cable breaks, all the tension from the springs
                    are put onto the side that isn't broken, causing your garage door to become crooked and unable to open or shut. If you notice any frays coming from a cable,
                    call us to replace them. Never touch any part associated with the springs or cables because they can cause injury or death. A quick call to 
                    Salt City Garage Doors could save you from an unneeded visit to the hospital. We're also Utah's #1 same day service company, so you can get out of your bind
